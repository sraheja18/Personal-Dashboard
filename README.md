# Personalized Dashboard

Presenting to you your personalized dashboard to track your daily stock prices and weather updates. It fetches the stock data from yfinance API and weather data from Open-Meteo API. It updates the data daily. This application also has a feature of sending out alerts for extreme stock price fluctations and extreme weather events on a person's email. This dashboard can be viewed as web application. I deployed the dashboard on AWS EC-2 instance. Therefore, it can accessed from any device with internet.

This dashboard tracks 2 stocks over the past week
- Microsoft
- Tesla

It also tracks weather for the upcoming week specifically
